# Coding practicing.

## About
This repo will include my solutions to various programming questions.
Its not specific to any single programming language. I will be using either:
* JavaScript
* Java
* C

References to the challenges will be commented out in each challenge source code.

```
Please feel free to create an issue to point out any flaws in
my code, ultimately, I am trying to practice to master my craft.
```
